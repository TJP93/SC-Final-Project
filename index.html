  <h1>My Website</h1>
  <p>Hello, and welcome to my first website. I'm hoping that this will be the first of many, and that future projects will look significantly better! Prior to taking part in Shift-Click I had minimal coding experience, and I am hoping that by moving on and taking part in the Full-Stack course I will be able to develop the skills required to earn a living in this industry.</p>
