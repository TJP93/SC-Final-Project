# Shift-Click Final Project - Tom Porter

## Welcome!

This website has been created to showcase what I have learned on the Shift-Click Intro to Coding Course, using my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

While it is still rather basic, I hope that this page shows how much I have progressed so far on my coding journey.
